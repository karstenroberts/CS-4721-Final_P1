This is the submission for part one of the final project. To run it, open index.html in the browser of your choice. All
javscript is located in the index.js, with the exception of external libraries located in the lib directory. This program
does not use .ply files; it generates all polygons procedurally. The spotlight is pointed slightly below the root pyramid,
and is located behind the camera.
